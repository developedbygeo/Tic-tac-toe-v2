A React-based, fully responsive, Tic Tac Toe game that features two modes - Player vs CPU & Player vs Player.

This project was a lovely opportunity to follow a structured Figma design and bring to life. For the CPU part, I implemented the minimax algorithm, to create an unbeatable AI.

Structure-wise, it is based on JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Emotion and Redux Toolkit. For a detailed overview, please have a look at the [**Features**](#features) & [**Tech**](#tech) section.

**Important Note**: All of the image assets, along with the design files were provided by Frontend Mentor, as part of the _Tic Tac Toe game_ challenge.
